# Kalima 
For this ongoing project, I  built a number of biometrics sensors, including heart rate, breath sensors, muscle tension, and Galvanic Skin Response (used in polygraph tests). I wrote code to process the biometric data with Arduino. Finally I designed  software instruments in Max/MSP driven by the biometric data.
